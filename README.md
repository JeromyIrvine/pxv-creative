# Pixelvania Creative Blocks Pack for Minecraft

The primary goal of the Creative Blocks Pack is to add "missing" blocks to the vanilla Minecraft game, such as concrete slabs, wooden floor tiles, or dark gray stone bricks. Most of the blocks in the pack will be either type variants (stairs, slabs, tile) or color variants of existing blocks. The pack will also contain new types of doors, to expand on the rather limit built-in variety.

New blocks may also be added, so long as they fit the overall asthetic of the vanilla Minecraft game.

The pack does not add any new mechanics or mobs to the game. It also does not (currently) include recipes to craft the blocks in survival mode.
