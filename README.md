# Pixelvania Creative Blocks Pack for Minecraft

The primary goal of the Creative Blocks Pack is to add "missing" blocks to the vanilla Minecraft game, such as concrete slabs, wooden floor tiles, or dark gray stone bricks. Most of the blocks in the pack will be either type variants (stairs, slabs, tile) or color variants of existing blocks. The pack will also contain new types of doors, to expand on the rather limited built-in variety.

New blocks may also be added, so long as they fit the overall aesthetic of the vanilla Minecraft game.

The pack does not add any new mechanics or mobs to the game. It also does not (currently) include recipes to craft the blocks in survival mode.

# Development

To get the project working in Visual Studio Code:

1. Install the [Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
2. Install the latest version of Visual Studio Code.
3. From the VS Code extensions pane, install the Language Support for Java by Red Hat extension.
4. Update your *java.home* setting to point to the installed JDK.
5. Run `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` to prepare the build environment.
